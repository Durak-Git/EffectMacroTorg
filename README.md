# Description

1.Simple macro to handle Attributes modifications generated by powers like Bless/Curse.</br>
**game.effectMacroTorg.torgBuff()</br>**
The macro asks which attribute you want to modify, or physical defense, and then generates the ActiveEffects also modifying every related skills.</br>
It considers restriction/upgrade already existing, with some infos in the console.

Example:</br>
  My DragonWarrior with 9 Dex and a limitation of MaxDex=10 gets a +3 buff</br>
    The effect will generate a +1 Effect, according to the limitation of 10.</br>
    
2.Macro for Threat Active defense, select one or more token, it generates the Defenses bonus</br>
**game.effectMacroTorg.simpleDefense()</br>**
No possibility/up/drama (reroll) compliant</br>
A second activation of the macro delete the AvtiveDefense for selected token</br>
The use of Times-Up module can handle automatic reset of effects</br>

3.A macro to show Drama cards, for powers that allows to **see**/reorder/discard some of them.</br>
**game.effectMacroTorg.dramaVision()</br>**
It does not make all this, just show to selected active players the next 1 to 3 cards from an active and started Combat encounter.

4.A macro to cancel the drama deck draw of a new round</br>
**game.effectMacroTorg.dramaFlashback()</br>**
Combat must be started, and not first round of course

5.A macro to cancel the play of a destiny card from a player (NOT a COSM)</br>
**game.effectMacroTorg.playerPlayback()</br>**
Better if it's the last message in the log. Ask for recipient

6.Added a script that un-pool cards of players at the end of combat.
(remove the flag)

7.Added a script that remove Stymied and Vulnerable staus when clicking "end of turn" in combat tracker.

8.Added a script that ask if you want to update the driver and the skill of a Vehicule actor</br>
when you drag and drop an actor on it.

# ScreenShots are coming, somed defaults will be listed
If you already created an exhaustive passive effect that handles the bonus, it could give bad values.</br>
Others surely, that's why it's mainly for a personnal use.

# How to use this Template to create a versioned Release

1. Open your repository's releases page.

![Where to click to open repository releases.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644614/93409301-9fd25080-f864-11ea-9e0c-bdd09e4418e4.png)

2. Click "Draft a new release"

![Draft a new release button.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644614/93409364-c1333c80-f864-11ea-89f1-abfcb18a8d9f.png)

3. Fill out the release version as the tag name.

If you want to add details at this stage you can, or you can always come back later and edit them.

![Release Creation Form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644614/93409543-225b1000-f865-11ea-9a19-f1906a724421.png)

4. Hit submit.

5. Wait a few minutes.

A Github Action will run to populate the `module.json` and `module.zip` with the correct urls that you can then use to distribute this release. You can check on its status in the "Actions" tab.

![Actions Tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644614/93409820-c1800780-f865-11ea-8c6b-c3792e35e0c8.png)

6. Grab the module.json url from the release's details page.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644614/93409960-10c63800-f866-11ea-83f6-270cc5d10b71.png)

This `module.json` will only ever point at this release's `module.zip`, making it useful for sharing a specific version for compatibility purposes.

7. You can use the url `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/module.json` to refer to the manifest.

This is the url you want to use to install the module typically, as it will get updated automatically.

# How to List Your Releases on Package Admin

To request a package listing for your first release, go to the [Package Submission Form](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/submit) (accessible via a link at the bottom of the "[Systems and Modules](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/)" page on the Foundry website).

Fill in the form. "Package Name" must match the name in the module manifest.  Package Title will be the display name for the package.  Package URL should be your repo URL.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36359784/120664263-b49e5500-c482-11eb-9126-af7006389903.png)


One of the Foundry staff will typically get back to you with an approval or any further questions within a few days, and give you access to the package admin pages.

Once you have access to the [module admin page](https://foundryvtt.com/admin/packages/package/), you can release a new version by going into the page for your module, scrolling to the bottom, and filling in a new Package Version.

When listing a new version, Version should be the version number you set above, and the Manifest URL should be the manifest __for that specific version__ (do not use /latest/ here).

> ### :warning: Important :warning:
> 
> It is very important that you use the specific release manifest url, and not the `/latest` url here. For more details about why this is important and how Foundry Installs/Updates packages, read [this wiki article](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/releases-and-history).

Clicking "Save" in the bottom right will save the new version, which means that anyone installing your module from within Foundry will get that version, and a post will be generated in the #release-announcements channel on the official Foundry VTT Discord.
